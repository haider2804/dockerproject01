Project Name: Cloud-Based Docker Image Management with Ubuntu and Red Hat Nodes on GCP

Project Description:
In this project, we will demonstrate the ability to pull a base Ubuntu image from Docker Hub, convert it into a running container, and customize it by installing additional software using a Dockerfile. We will work on two Red Hat 8.0 nodes deployed in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The customized Docker image created on Node 1 will be pushed to Docker Hub, and then pulled on Node 2 to showcase cross-node image management in the cloud. This project will illustrate Docker image creation, container orchestration, image upload, and retrieval from Docker Hub.
